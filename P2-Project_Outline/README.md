## Submission Instructions

Title: Project Outline,


Overview: Have you as a business owner every looked for something you could of sworn you had for hours only to realize you sold
it last week, or even worse bought something not knowing you already had it in the inventory? If you are like most small business
owners, I'd bet you have. My inspiration came directly from my uncle who runs a business as a carpenter, he has a garage full of stuff
with little to no idea whats in there. I simply told him something has to change, and just  like that an idea was born.

With this easy to use inventory application not only will you save money but also time, and as business owners know time is 
money. Login from the homepage and get direct acess to your inventory, add items and quantity, and even make scanable barcodes to 
make adding the product easier in the future.

1. User Login: Users will be able to create accounts and login to the application.

2. Add Products: Users will have the ability to add a new product to the inventory list.

3. Create Barcodes: Users will be able to create barcodes for their products.

4. Inventory Display Page: Items will be able to view all items and quanities in the inventory

Java

Springboot

MySQL



What will i have to learn?
I would like to learn react for the project, but as well i will learn how to build an application from the ground up as opposed
to having starter code. The biggest problem I have identified is getting the app to react to the scanner.
